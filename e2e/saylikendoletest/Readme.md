1. I have identified test scenarios for all acceptance criteria and specified them in 'Test Scenarios.xlsx'.
2. There are three test specifications written catering to all 4 acceptance criteria. 
3. An additional test spec for bonus scenario for Level 2 item search is placed in 'Test_Level2_Search.js'.
4. All Test spec files are placed here: \qa-test\e2e\saylikendoletest\spec
5. Conf.js file is placed here : \qa-test\e2e\saylikendoletest which is configered to run all 4 test specifications
6. I have enabled Parellelized testing so all four test specifications will run in parellel. 
7. I have also enabled Test Report generation. Reports and Screenshots will be generated automatically and will be saved in:  \qa-test\e2e\saylikendoletest\target
	reporter tool need to be installed by using 'npm install protractor-jasmine2-html-reporter'
